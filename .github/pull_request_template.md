### Before the PR
You should always test your script as a regular phoenicis user, and it should be working BEFORE doing the PR. However, if you have a specific problem or misunderstanding that prevents your script from working, you can still open the PR **to ask for help** (use draft for this). 

### Ready for review
Maintainers will only review your PR if codacy and travis runs perfectly (advise: first run eslint and json-align according do the doc). You can however ping them if you think there is a problem with those tools (use draft for this).

### PR Name
The PR name should be:
```
Update/add app/functionnality : reasons
```
Use the PR comment to be more verbose.



Please delete this text when making the PR ;-)
