This page describes best practices for writing your scripts.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your script
3. Clone your fork to your local scripts repository (usually `~/.Phoenicis/repository/`)
4. Checkout your branch
5. Follow the [how to](https://github.com/PhoenicisOrg/scripts/blob/master/README.md)
6. Commit your changes and create a pull request

## Unfinished scripts
If your script is unfinished/not fully tested but you still want to share it (e.g. because you need help), create a pull request and label it "help wanted". People can then help you with comments or by submitting pull requests for the branch on your fork.
