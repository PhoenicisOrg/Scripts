    "description" : "From a single cell to a galactic deity, develop your creation in the world of your ideas.<br/>Play Spore on five levels of development: Cells, Creatures, Tribes, Civilizations and the Universe. Each level has its own unique style, challenges and goals. Play as you like - start with a cell and develop one species from a small organism to an intergalactic traveler or directly begin to build tribes and civilizations on new planets. What you do in your universe depends only on you.<br/>Spore gives you a variety of powerful but easy-to-use tools that help you create and change every aspect of your universe: creatures, vehicles, buildings, and even spaceships. Although Spore is a single player game, all of your creations are automatically shared for other players, providing an infinite number of worlds to explore and play."
