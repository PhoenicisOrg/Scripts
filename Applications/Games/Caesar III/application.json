How you accomplish this is entirely up to you. Gain wealth and power, make a career out of pleasing the emperor, battle Barbarians and repel invaders or concentrate on building the next Eternal City. Fail and youâ€™ll end up as lunch for the lions. Prove your strength of mind and spirit and you just may be crowned Caesar!"
