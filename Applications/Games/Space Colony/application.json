    "description" : "Save the colony! Your crew are fighting and new life forms begin to appear in the canteen. You are somewhere in the Universe with a limited amount of resources, a corporation that sent you into space awaits back at the Earth, and your colonists expect payment. Everyone has their own mind, so remember the golden rule: a happy crew is a productive crew. You must build a base and defend it against aliens, but do not forget about your crew. If you treat them well, they will work hard for you. In Space Colony your career and life depend on an unruly team that wants to return to Earth. When creating a colony, you have over 100 different structures to choose from, which will help you build a great base for your crew. So before you spend all your savings on iron mining and the production of space chickens, keep in mind that without laser towers, saunas and restaurants no one will want to work for you!"
