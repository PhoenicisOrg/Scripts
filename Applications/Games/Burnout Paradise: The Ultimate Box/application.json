    "description" : "Paradise City is the largest and most dangerous setting yet for the best-selling Burnout series. The massive setting gives players an open-ended world to explore, as they race their vehicles through hundreds of miles of roads and underground passages with more than 70 different cars. Speed through the streets from event to event, racking up points that are saved to your Paradise City driver’s license. Earn the vaunted “Burnout” license by smashing through billboards, jumping ramps, and sustaining crashes with the improved damage system."
