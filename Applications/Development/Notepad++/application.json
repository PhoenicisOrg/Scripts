Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.<br><br>Based on a powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.<br><br>Source: http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm"
